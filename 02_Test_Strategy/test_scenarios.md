###  Performance Testing Scenarios

- [ ] **1. Baseline Performance Test**
  * **Load:** 5 users
  * **Duration:** 5 minutes
  * **Objective:** Establish the initial benchmark performance under minimum load.

- [ ] **2. Load Test**
  * **Load:** 50 users
  * **Strategy:** 5-minute ramp-up period
  * **Duration:** 20-minute steady state duration
  * **Objective:** Verify system behavior under expected normal operational volumes.

- [ ] **3. Stress Test**
  * **Load:** Incremental steps (50 → 100 → 150 → ...)
  * **Objective:** Continuously increase load until the system experiences failure to find the breaking point.

- [ ] **4. Spike Test**
  * **Load Profile:** 20 users → 200 users → 20 users
  * **Objective:** Evaluate how the system recovers from sudden, extreme bursts of traffic.

- [ ] **5. Endurance (Soak) Test**
  * **Load:** 50 users
  * **Duration:** 2 hours
  * **Objective:** Identify potential memory leaks, resource degradation, or long-term instability.

- [ ] **6. Capacity Test**
  * **Load:** Continuous scale-up
  * **Objective:** Increase traffic until the maximum capability is reached. Testing stops if:
    *  An SLA is breached
    *  Error rate exceeds 1%
    *  Response times become unacceptable
